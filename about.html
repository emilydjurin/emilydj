    ABOUT ME
  </h2>
  <p2>
    Hi, I’m Emily! Thank you for taking the time to view this site and learn a little more about me outside of my resume. 
      </p2>
      <p2>
Some background about me is I was born in Chicago but spent most of my life growing up in Boca Raton, Florida (although I still root for only Chicago sports teams). Then, in 2018, I made my way up to College Park, Maryland to start college. Throughout the years I have become very passionate about a wide range of things including live music, yoga, film, cooking and many more (my friends often make comments about my many different “obsessions” but I love all of my “obsessions” regardless). I am an outgoing and positive person who is always excited and eager to learn new things and meet new people!
      </p2> 
      <p2>
Enjoy looking through my website and thank you again for visiting!

    EDUCATION
  </h>
  <pam>
    I am currently a junior at the University of Maryland working towards a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Film and an expected graduation of Fall 2021.
  </pam>
  <pam>
    Some of my relevant CS coursework includes Object Oriented Programing I & II, Computer Systems, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms, and Organization of Programming Languages. I am currently taking classes where I am learning about computer architecture and java concurrency. In the spring I will be taking Handheld Programming, Database Design, and Intro to PHP & Javascript. So by the Summer I will be well versed in these fields as well!
  </pam>

    PASSION
  </h>
  <pam>
    I am extremely interested and passionate about the connection between modern technology and entertainment and hope to explore their relationship even more through an internship this summer. As you can see from this website alone, I am an avid consumer of multiple forms of entertainment and would love to learn more about how technology influences them and will continue to influence them in the future!
  </pam>
  <h>
    SKILLS
  </h>
  <pam>
    Through both my coursework and previous internship experience I have become confident working with Java, C, SQL, HTML, CSS and am also somewhat familiar with Ruby and Ocaml. I also have experience with working in a Linux Environment and with Unix.
  </pam>
  <pam>
    In addition to these skills, I have years of experience working in professional office settings with teams of coworkers in both technical and non-technical departments. I am an extremely quick learner who is eager and willing to learn new skills!
